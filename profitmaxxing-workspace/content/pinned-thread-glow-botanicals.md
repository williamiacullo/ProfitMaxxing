**Tweet 1 (Hook — 217 chars):**
I analyzed a $2M/year clean beauty brand's financials. They're leaving $9,400/month on the table. Here's exactly where the money is going — and how to find these leaks in your own brand. A thread:

**Tweet 2 (Finding 1: CAC — 270 chars):**
Finding 1: Their blended CAC was $31. Looked fine on paper. But when we split by channel — Meta was $24, TikTok was $52. They were scaling TikTok spend because "it's working" but never ran the numbers by channel. Cutting TikTok by 40% saved $2,800/month. Zero revenue impact.

**Tweet 3 (Finding 2: Fulfillment — 274 chars):**
Finding 2: Fulfillment cost per order was $6.85 — they thought it was $4.20. The gap? Returns processed without product recapture. Damaged goods at 4.1%. Oversized boxes on 60% of orders. Three fixes, 90 days. New CPO: $4.10. That's $2,750/month recovered on 1,000 orders.

**Tweet 4 (Finding 3: Welcome Discount — 267 chars):**
Finding 3: 15% welcome discount on a $92 AOV. We tested dropping to 10%. Conversion rate went from 4.2% to 4.1% — basically flat. But margin per order jumped $4.60. At 38 new customers/day, that's $5,250/month they were giving away to people who would have bought anyway.

**Tweet 5 (Finding 4: Subscription — 260 chars):**
Finding 4: No subscription option on their best-selling serum. 23% of customers reordered within 90 days anyway. We modeled a 10% subscribe-and-save: even with the discount, predictable revenue + reduced CAC on repeat orders = $3,200/month in incremental margin by month 6.

**Tweet 6 (Finding 5: Inventory — 246 chars):**
Finding 5: Inventory turns at 2.8x/year. Industry benchmark is 4-6x. They had $180K in slow-moving stock. Liquidating the bottom 15% and tightening reorder points freed up $47K in working capital and cut warehousing costs by $1,100/month. Dead inventory is dead money.

**Tweet 7 (The Total — 220 chars):**
Total monthly recovery: $9,400/month. $112,800/year. From a $2M brand. No new products. No new channels. No new hires. Just measuring what was already there and fixing what the data showed. Most brands have these same five leaks.

**Tweet 8 (CTA — 249 chars):**
