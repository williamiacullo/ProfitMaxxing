Most DTC founders don't know their true fulfillment cost per order. They see "$3.50 shipping" and think they're good. Measure labor, packaging, 3PL fees, returns processing. We see brands at $1.5M revenue paying $6.20/order they could cut to $4.10. Do the math.

Your accountant is filing taxes. A CFO is managing cash. These are not the same person. If you only talk to your accountant once a year, you're making decisions in the dark. DTC brands need quarterly reviews minimum. Most miss 4-6 planning opportunities annually.

Hot take: a 15% welcome discount costs more than you think. AOV of $85, 40 customers/day — that's $510 in daily revenue gone. Most of those people would have bought anyway. Test 10% and watch your margins improve without losing conversions.

Stop obsessing over cost per acquisition. Start tracking profit per customer in month 1. A $15 CAC looks great until your first-order margin is 12%. That's not a customer. That's a loss leader you'll never recover from without a retention strategy that actually works.

If your inventory turns less than 3x per year, you're sitting on dead weight. For DTC, 4-6x is standard. At $1M in inventory, the difference between 2x and 4x turns is $80K-120K in working capital you could deploy on growth. Every month it sits costs you.

Benchmark check for DTC at $2M revenue: COGS 30-40%, fulfillment 8-12%, marketing 15-25%, operations 8-12%. If you're outside these ranges, something's broken. We audited 12 brands last month. 8 had fulfillment costs above 18%. All fixable within 90 days.

DTC brands at $1-3M have the worst margins in the game. Too big to run scrappy. Too small to get volume discounts. No ops infrastructure, no supplier leverage, inefficient fulfillment. The fix is boring: ruthless metric tracking. Weekly. Non-negotiable.

Your 3PL is probably overcharging you if: you don't get monthly detailed reports, you don't know your damaged goods %, and your pick/pack rates haven't been renegotiated in 18+ months. If all three apply, you're paying 15-25% above market. Get competitive quotes.

Before/after we see constantly: founders tracking inventory in spreadsheets, thinking it's "fine." Then they realize they're carrying 22% excess stock. Monthly audits + automation = $40-80K freed up per $1M in revenue. Usually within 90 days. Boring but profitable.

Q1 reality for DTC founders: if you did over $1M in revenue last year and haven't finalized your 2026 tax strategy, you're leaving money on the table. Entity structure and quarterly planning matter. Talk to a tax strategist this month. Not in April.

## PIN TWEET — Post and pin tonight (this is your origin story)

I spent 5 years doing financial strategy for high-net-worth clients. The frameworks are the same whether you're managing $50M in assets or a $2M Shopify brand — find where money leaks, measure it, fix it.

Now I apply that rigor to DTC brands because most founders at $1-3M have nobody looking at their numbers. Not their accountant. Not their dashboard. Nobody connecting marketing spend, fulfillment costs, and unit economics into one picture.

That's what I do.

**Notes:** This is 3 tweets if threaded, or one long tweet if Twitter allows it (currently 4,000 char limit for verified/premium). Post as a single tweet if your account has long-form. If not, post as a 3-tweet thread and pin the first one. This establishes credibility for every profile visitor.
