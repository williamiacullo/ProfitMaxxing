## Template C — Slack/Discord DTC Communities

## Post 1: 3PL Fulfillment Cost Benchmarks
**Best for:** DTC Slack communities (Ecommerce Accelerator, DTC Founders), Discord servers (Indie Hackers, Founder communities)
**Post:**
We just audited fulfillment costs across 40+ DTC brands and found a major spread at the $2-5M revenue stage. Brands paying $2.10-$2.80 per order for domestic 2-3 day fulfillment are actually at the high end — leaders are hitting $1.85-$2.20 through carrier rate negotiation and zone optimization. The gap? Most teams bundle fulfillment cost with shipping cost and miss margin capture. Happy to share the full breakdown — just DM me.

## Post 2: Customer Acquisition Cost by Category
**Best for:** DTC Slack communities (Ecommerce Accelerator, Growth Masters), Discord servers (Indie Hackers, Marketing channels)
**Post:**
Category matters way more than most founders think. Skincare brands at breakeven CAC are sitting around $18-24 per acquisition (paid channels), but apparel is $12-16, and supplements hit $20-28. The data shows brands often benchmark against competitors in different categories and walk away feeling like their CAC is broken when it's actually category-norm. If you're below these benchmarks, your real edge is retention, not acquisition. Happy to share the full breakdown — just DM me.

## Post 3: Subscription Churn Rates by Month
**Best for:** DTC Slack communities (Retention-focused channels, Subscription businesses), Discord servers (SaaS/DTC hybrid communities)
**Post:**
Subscription churn is the metric everyone tracks but rarely compares. We see across brands: Month 1 churn ranges 15-28% (expected), but Month 3-6 churn is where the real signal is. Best-in-class subscription brands sit at 3-6% monthly churn by Month 6, while average sits at 8-12%. If your Month 6 churn is 12%+, your LTV is getting compressed by retention, not acquisition. The fix is usually product or communication, not more volume. Happy to share the full breakdown — just DM me.

## Content Strategy Notes

**Template C Characteristics:**
- Pure value: Benchmarks only, no pitch language
- Specificity: Each post includes a data range or comparison
- Community-appropriate: Positioned as shared intelligence, not service mention
- Call-to-action: "Happy to share the full breakdown — just DM me" (inbound generation)
- Tone: Analyst, peer, educational

**Posting Schedule:**
- Space posts 3-5 days apart to avoid community saturation
- Post 1 (3PL): Target Tuesday-Wednesday (operations-focused founders active)
- Post 2 (CAC): Target Wednesday-Thursday (marketing founders active)
- Post 3 (Churn): Target Thursday-Friday (growth/retention-focused founders active)

**Community Distribution:**
- Primary: DTC Founders Slack, Ecommerce Accelerator (widest reach)
- Secondary: Indie Hackers Discord, Founder-focused communities
- Avoid: Direct pitching channels; stick to insight/education-first spaces

**Engagement Expectations:**
- Typical engagement: 8-15 comments per post (benchmark discussions, pushback)
- DM inbound rate: 3-8% of post views convert to "tell me more" DMs
- Repost potential: Posts are generic enough to repost quarterly with updated data
