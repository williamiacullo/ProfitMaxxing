## Script

[CUT — direct to camera]
"Most DTC founders have no idea where their money is actually going."

[CUT]
"They see revenue going up. They assume they're profitable. Then Q4 hits and they can't figure out why there's no cash in the account."

[CUT]
"Here's the problem: your accountant files taxes. Your Shopify dashboard shows revenue. But nobody is connecting your ad spend, your fulfillment costs, your inventory carrying costs, and your unit economics into one picture."

[CUT]
"That's what I do."

[CUT]
"I spent 5 years doing financial strategy for high-net-worth clients. The frameworks are the same whether you're managing $50 million in assets or a $2 million Shopify brand."

[CUT]
"Find where money leaks. Measure it. Fix it."

[CUT]
"If you're a DTC brand doing $500K to $5 million and you don't have someone looking at your numbers like this — that's the problem."

[CUT — slow down, direct eye contact]
"That's ProfitMaxxing."

## Filming Notes

- **Energy:** Confident but not salesy. Think analyst briefing a CEO, not guru pitching a course.
- **Pace:** Fast cuts. Each line is 3-6 seconds max. The Reel should feel tight.
- **Wardrobe:** Business casual. No suits, no hoodies. Button-down or clean polo.
- **Lighting:** Natural light or ring light. Clean and professional.
- **Sound:** Use a trending audio at low volume behind the talking, or no music. Captions are mandatory.
- **CTA:** Don't say "follow me" or "link in bio" — the content should drive that naturally. The end card with your handle is enough.

## Caption

Most DTC founders at $1-3M don't have anyone looking at their numbers. Not their accountant. Not their Shopify dashboard. Nobody connecting ad spend, fulfillment, inventory, and unit economics into one picture.

That's the gap. That's what we fix.

## Why This Works as Reel #1

1. **Establishes credibility** — 5 years UHNW finance, same frameworks applied to DTC
2. **Identifies the pain** — founders think they're profitable but cash disappears
3. **Positions ProfitMaxxing** — not an accountant, not a dashboard, but a strategic financial analyst for your brand
4. **Short and punchy** — Instagram rewards watch-through rate. 45-60 sec is the sweet spot for talking head Reels in 2026
5. **No pitch** — just "this is the problem, this is what I do." The audience self-selects.

## Reel #2 Concept (Next Week)

"The $1-3M DTC margin trap" — same format, walks through why brands at this revenue stage have the worst margins and what to do about it. Pulls from Carousel 4 content.

## Reel #3 Concept (Week After)

"Your welcome discount is costing more than you think" — quick math breakdown on camera. Pulls from Carousel 3 content. Use on-screen text overlays for the numbers.
