# Twitter Reply Batch — @ProfitMaxxingco — 2026-02-15

## Strategy

Reply to active DTC/ecommerce conversations to get @ProfitMaxxingco visible in the right feeds. Rules:
- Add genuine value — no "great post" energy
- Drop a specific data point or contrarian angle
- Never pitch. Never link. Never mention ProfitMaxxing.
- Keep under 280 chars per reply
- Tone: knowledgeable peer who happened to see the tweet
- LANGUAGE FRAME: You are a financial analyst who benchmarks DTC brands. Use "the data shows," "we see across brands," "when you run the numbers." NEVER use "when we scaled," "we tested this at our brand," or any language implying you operate a DTC brand. You analyze them.

## Reply 1: @VezmarJovan — DTC brands treating Amazon as a side channel

**Original tweet (2h ago):** "Most DTC brands treat Amazon like a side channel. It's not. It's its own ecosystem with its own economics. Different traffic. Different intent. Different margins."

**Reply (267 chars):**
This is the part most founders miss — they look at Amazon revenue and assume the margins translate. They don't. Referral fees + FBA + ad spend usually eat 15-22% more than DTC. You need separate P&Ls for each channel or you're flying blind on true profitability.

**Why this works:** Adds a specific number (15-22%) to his general observation. His audience of DTC founders will see @ProfitMaxxingco adding financial specificity to a growth conversation.

## Reply 2: @ttllbb0 (Taskin Labib) — Blended ROAS is the biggest lie in DTC

**Original tweet (10h ago):** "Blended ROAS is one of the biggest lies in DTC. It hides that your Wallet (7x ROAS) is paying for your Backpack's funeral (0.8x ROAS). You're taking profit from a winner to keep a loser alive on life support. Stop averaging. Kill the parasite to save the host."

**Reply (274 chars):**
The wallet/backpack framing is perfect. Same thing happens with channels — Meta might show 4x while TikTok shows 1.2x, but blended says 2.8x and the founder thinks everything's fine. Track contribution margin by SKU AND by channel. That's where the real picture lives.

**Why this works:** Extends his product-level insight to channel-level, which is ProfitMaxxing's wheelhouse. Shows depth without disagreeing.

## Reply 3: @ceokasper (Eric Kasper) — Boring ecommerce ops saves you on shock days

**Original tweet (14h ago):** "The most boring part of ecommerce ops is what saves you on shock days. We start every morning by walking the exception board before opening Slack. Orders stuck in 3PL status for >2 hrs get escalated to the shift lead. Inbound ASN past due? Call the supplier before they wake their..."

**Reply (271 chars):**
This is the operational discipline that separates brands clearing 28% margins from those stuck at 16%. The unglamorous daily review is worth more than any tool subscription. Most founders at $1-3M skip this because they're still wearing every hat. That's where the margin leaks.

**Why this works:** Ties operational discipline to margin outcomes with specific numbers (28% vs 16%, $1-3M). Positions ProfitMaxxing's perspective naturally.

## Reply 4: @jordanoc32 (Jordan O'Connor) — Direct mail as underrated DTC channel

**Original tweet (Feb 14):** "Direct mail will be the most underrated DTC revenue channel in 2026. We just ran a direct mail campaign test that hit a 3.5x ROAS. In a few months, it will be generating close to $30k/mo. The first test campaign results: $8K revenue, 3.5x ROAS, 50 conversions."

**Reply (276 chars):**
The real question founders should ask after seeing 3.5x ROAS on direct mail: what's the contribution margin per conversion vs. your Meta conversions at the same ROAS? Postage + print + list costs hit differently than CPMs. ROAS alone doesn't tell you which channel is more profitable.

**Why this works:** Doesn't disagree — challenges the metric. DTC founders reading this thread will see ProfitMaxxing pushing for deeper analysis, which is exactly the brand positioning.

## Reply 5: @ShipsaLot — 3PL red flag (5 days to ship a 2-day order)

**Original tweet (Feb 14):** "The biggest red flag in ecommerce? A 3PL that takes 5 days to ship a 2-day order. Green flag? Ships A Lot. Same-day processing. Zero drama."

**Reply (271 chars):**
Bigger red flag: not knowing your actual fulfillment cost per order. Most founders at $1-3M know their shipping rate but not their true CPO — pick/pack, materials, handling fees, damages, returns. When you add it up, the real number is usually 40-60% higher than the shipping line item.

**Why this works:** Pivots from their self-promotional angle to a genuine insight. Founders reading this thread are already thinking about fulfillment — this gives them something actionable.

## Reply 6: @copyimperialist (Muhammad) — The ad's only job is to get the click

**Original tweet (Feb 14):** "The ad's only job is to get the click. If you disagree, you're judging the wrong part of your funnel. Too many DTC brands mistakenly blame their ads when sales are low, complaining about creative fatigue or declining ROAS."

**Reply (278 chars):**
Underrated take. The number of DTC founders who optimize ads while ignoring post-click economics is staggering. Your landing page, pricing, and unit economics matter more than your creative. A brand with 35% margins and bad ads will outlast one with 12% margins and perfect creative every time.

**Why this works:** Shifts from marketing to financial fundamentals — exactly ProfitMaxxing's angle. Positions the account as someone who thinks about the business holistically, not just the ad dashboard.
