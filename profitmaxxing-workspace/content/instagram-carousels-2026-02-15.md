## Carousel 1: The Hidden Cost of Slow Inventory Turns

**Slide 1:** Your Inventory Is Bleeding Cash And You Don't See It

**Slide 2:** At $1M in inventory, the difference between 2x and 4x turns is $80K-$120K in trapped working capital. Every month products sit unsold is a month you can't deploy that cash on growth.

**Slide 3:** What turns actually mean: 3x = your average product sits 120 days before selling. 4x = 90 days. 6x = 60 days. The longer items sit, the higher your carrying costs — storage, obsolescence risk, damage, insurance.

**Slide 4:** Real math: $300K inventory at 3x turns costs roughly $45K/year in carrying costs. Same inventory at 5x turns? $27K/year. That's $18K freed up just by moving product faster. No new revenue needed.

**Slide 5:** How to improve: monthly inventory audits, SKU rationalization (kill your bottom 20%), demand forecasting, and faster supplier reorder cycles. Most brands can go from 3x to 4.5x within 6 months.

**Slide 6:** Start this week: calculate your total inventory value. Divide annual COGS by average inventory. If it's below 4x, you have a working capital problem hiding in plain sight.

**Slide 7:** We help DTC brands optimize inventory turns and unlock trapped cash. See how at profitmaxxing.com

## Carousel 2: Your Accountant Is Not Your CFO

**Slide 1:** Your Accountant Files Taxes. A CFO Manages Cash. These Are Not The Same Role.

**Slide 2:** What an accountant does: reports on what already happened. Files taxes. Handles compliance. Runs monthly P&Ls. All backward-looking. Necessary — but not enough for a growing DTC brand.

**Slide 3:** What a CFO does: forecasts what's coming. Identifies cash problems before they hit. Manages working capital. Negotiates with suppliers. Builds financial strategy. All forward-looking.

**Slide 4:** Example: your accountant says "you did $1.8M in revenue, filing deadline is April 15th." A CFO says "at your current burn rate and inventory plan, you'll run short on cash in September. Here's how to avoid it."

**Slide 5:** Most DTC founders talk to their accountant once a year. A CFO-level review should happen quarterly minimum. One missed cash forecast costs thousands. One optimized inventory turn saves tens of thousands.

**Slide 6:** You don't need to hire a full-time CFO at your stage. You need quarterly financial strategy reviews with someone who thinks like one. The cost of not having this is invisible — until it isn't.

**Slide 7:** We do quarterly financial reviews for growing DTC brands. Strategic, not just compliant. Learn more at profitmaxxing.com

## Carousel 3: The Math Behind Your Welcome Discount

**Slide 1:** Your 15% Welcome Discount Is Costing More Than You Think

**Slide 2:** If 60% of welcome offer customers would have bought anyway, you're giving away margin on auto-conversions. That's not acquisition cost. That's pure profit leakage.

**Slide 3:** The math: $95 AOV, 35% margins, 15% discount = $14.25 margin lost per order. At 40 new customers/day, if 24 would convert without the discount, you're losing $342/day. $124K/year.

**Slide 4:** The test: drop from 15% to 10%. Most brands see almost no conversion change. Margin per order jumps $4.75. Same 40 customers. $190/day in recovered margin. $69K/year from one small change.

**Slide 5:** The principle: your welcome offer should feel special — not be the only reason someone buys. If conversion drops more than 5% when you reduce the offer, your targeting or product-market fit needs work.

**Slide 6:** Your numbers will be different but the framework is the same: every percentage point of discount matters. Run the math on your actual data before accepting industry defaults.

**Slide 7:** We help brands optimize pricing strategy and recover hidden margin. Let's look at yours at profitmaxxing.com

## Carousel 4: The $1-3M Revenue Margin Crisis

**Slide 1:** DTC Brands At $1-3M Revenue Have The Worst Margins. Here's Why.

**Slide 2:** At $500K you're scrappy and lean. At $5M you have supplier leverage and scale. At $2M? You're stuck in the middle — spending more, lacking scale, no operational systems yet.

**Slide 3:** Real comparison: a $500K brand might clear 32% net margin. A $5M brand with infrastructure hits 28%. A $2M brand without systems? Usually 16-18%. The gap is operational, not revenue.

**Slide 4:** Where the margin leaks: fulfillment costs too high (no volume leverage), marketing channels untested (spending on feel not data), inventory carrying costs (not optimized), overhead creeping up (hiring without ROI measurement).

**Slide 5:** The fix is unsexy: weekly unit economics tracking. Monthly P&L reviews. Quarterly supplier renegotiations. Monthly inventory audits. This is what separates 28% margin brands from 16% margin brands.

**Slide 6:** Most $2M brands could hit 24-26% margins with operational rigor alone. That's $120-200K annually in recovered profit. No new revenue required. Just better measurement.

**Slide 7:** We build financial measurement systems for $1-3M DTC brands. See where your margins stand at profitmaxxing.com

## Carousel 5: Q1 2026 Benchmarks Every DTC Founder Should Know

**Slide 1:** These Are Your Q1 2026 Benchmarks. Know Where You Stand.

**Slide 2:** Gross Margin by Revenue Tier (supplement/food): $500K-$1M: 55-62% | $1M-$2M: 52-58% | $2M-$3M: 50-55% | $3M-$5M: 48-52%. Below these? You have a unit economics problem.

**Slide 3:** Marketing Spend as % of Revenue: $500K-$1M: 25-35% | $1M-$2M: 20-28% | $2M-$5M: 15-25%. Too high and you're buying growth on credit. Too low and you're stalling. Find your balance.

**Slide 4:** Fulfillment + Shipping as % of Revenue: $500K-$1M: 12-16% | $1M-$3M: 10-14% | $3M-$5M: 8-11%. Above these numbers? Your 3PL or packaging strategy needs a review.

**Slide 5:** Blended CAC by Category: Food/supplement: $8-18 | Beauty: $12-25 | Fitness: $10-20 | Niche: $15-35. If CAC exceeds 40% of first order value, your growth model needs rethinking.

**Slide 6:** Repeat Purchase Rate — the hidden multiplier: Month 3: 8-15% | Month 6: 12-20% | Month 12: 18-28%. Better repeat rates beat lower CAC every time. This is where your fastest wins are.

**Slide 7:** Benchmark yourself. Find the gaps. That's your roadmap to 25%+ margins. Personalized audits at profitmaxxing.com
