## LANGUAGE FRAME (same as always)
You are a financial analyst who benchmarks DTC brands. Use "the data shows," "we see across brands," "when you run the numbers." NEVER use "when we scaled," "we tested this at our brand," or any language implying you operate a DTC brand. You analyze them.

## Reply 1: @LingeshShankad — DTC brand replaced Meta ads with creators & cut CAC by 40%

**Original tweet (Feb 14):** "This DTC brand replaced Meta ads with creators & cut CAC by 40%. Instead of $5k on ads, they activated 15 micro-creators with a structured UGC brief."

**Reply (272 chars):**
CAC reduction is great but the question nobody asks: what happened to contribution margin per order? We see brands cut CAC by 30-40% with creator content but their AOV drops 15-20% because creator audiences buy differently. Net margin impact is what actually matters here.

**Why:** Doesn't disagree, adds financial depth. Shows ProfitMaxxing thinks beyond the headline metric.

## Reply 2: @Jeremy_Ho... — The Affordable DTC Brand got slaughtered in 2025

**Original tweet (Feb 12):** "The Affordable DTC Brand got slaughtered in 2025. The CAC + COGS + Fulfillment math doesn't math. 10 yrs ago, affordable luxury was the DTC play. MVMT Watches, Pura Vida, Casper. Non-premium biz gets crushed. Luxury/Premium brands are the only ones crushing it."

**Reply (274 chars):**
The math breakdown is real. At sub-$50 AOV, you need 45%+ gross margins AND 4x+ ROAS just to break even on first purchase. Most affordable DTC brands are running 28-32% gross margins. The only path at that price point is retention-funded growth, and most aren't set up for it.

**Why:** Adds specific numbers to his thesis. Shows the exact math that proves his point. His audience (ecom buyers/operators) will appreciate the precision.

## Reply 3: @yiqiw_ — Meta campaigns profitable / retargeting blind spot

**Original tweet (9h ago):** "Our Meta campaigns are profitable." Are they? Or are you paying Meta to retarget customers who were going to buy anyway? Here's the blind spot most DTC brands don't realize they have..."

**Reply (268 chars):**
The incrementality gap is one of the biggest margin leaks we see. Run a holdout test and most brands find 30-40% of their "Meta conversions" would have happened organically. At $50K/month in ad spend, that's $15-20K in wasted attribution. The data is usually uncomfortable.

**Why:** Supports his thesis with specific dollar impact. "Incrementality gap" positions ProfitMaxxing as analytically sophisticated.
