## Tier 1 — Strong Pain Signal + Right Fit (Outreach ASAP)

| Rank | Name | Handle | Brand | Category | Revenue Est. | Pain Signal | Template | Why Priority |

| 1 | Ron Shah | @obviceo | Obvi | Supplements/Collagen | $3M–$8M | Rising ad costs, pivoting to subscription-first | A | Public pain signal about CAC. Active on Twitter.

| 2 | Alexa Anglin | @roewellness (IG) | Roe Wellness | Clean Skincare (Baby/Mom) | $500K–$2M | Research-based | B | Perfect target profile: founder-led, niche category, Shopify, physical products with COGS complexity (skincare formulations).

| 3 | Gloria Noto | @glorianoto | NOTO Botanics | Clean Beauty | $500K–$2M | Research-based | B | Small team, founder-led, Shopify, gender-inclusive skincare. Former makeup artist — creative founder, unlikely to have deep financial infrastructure. Right revenue tier. |
| 4 | Ngoc Nhi | Unknown | Forever Beaumore | Beauty/Wellness | $1M–$3M | Research-based | B | 15+ years in skincare, strong community, Shopify + Appbrew. San Jose physical location. Asian beauty rituals = ingredient complexity = COGS complexity. Family-run feel. |
| 5 | Josh Conard | @JoshConard121 | Unknown | Ecommerce | $500K–$2M | Struggling with fulfillment costs and FBM order tracking | A | Explicit public pain about fulfillment cost visibility. Template A — lead with fulfillment cost benchmarks. Need to research his actual brand. |

| 7 | Fran Miller | @fmillerskincare (?) | F. Miller Skincare | Botanical Skincare | $500K–$1.5M | B | Minimalist, premium, small team. Canadian. Likely no dedicated finance person. Right at the sweet spot of revenue where every dollar matters. |
