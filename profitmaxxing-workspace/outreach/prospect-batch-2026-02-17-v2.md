## PROSPECT RESEARCH NOTES

### Selection Criteria Applied
- All prospects are **founder-led** with identifiable names and verified Instagram accounts
- Revenue estimates based on public statements, funding rounds, and market data (conservative estimates applied)
- All prospects are **DTC-first** or DTC-significant in distribution
- None appear on existing Batch 1, Batch 2, or Disqualified lists
- All operate in target categories: clean beauty, wellness, supplements, skincare, food & beverage adjacencies, home goods, or personal care
- All show signs of **financial complexity**: multi-channel growth, subscription models, rapid scaling, or international operations

### Financial Pain Points to Target in Outreach
1. **Multi-channel complexity**: DTC + retail + international = complex P&L management, margin tracking, CAC by channel
2. **Subscription/recurring revenue**: Requires cohort analysis, churn modeling, LTV optimization, gross margin waterfall by cohort
3. **Rapid growth**: Scale without financial infrastructure = cash burn monitoring, unit economics at risk, pricing optimization gaps
4. **Retail expansion**: Wholesale discounting, inventory write-downs, payment terms negotiation requires sophisticated financial modeling
5. **Inventory management**: Multiple SKUs, seasonality, international sourcing = working capital optimization opportunity
6. **CAC efficiency**: Social-first acquisition models need attribution modeling and channel profitability analysis
7. **Omnichannel operations**: DTC + retail + partnerships requires complex financial consolidation and profitability by channel

### Research Sources
- BeautyIndependent.com (fastest-growing DTC brands 2025)
- Business of Fashion (indie brands to watch)
- Modern Retail (omnichannel strategy articles)
- TechCrunch (funding announcements)

- Direct brand websites and Instagram verification

### Next Steps for Sales Team
1. **Prioritize Tier 1** for initial outreach (better pain signals, faster deal close potential)
2. **Verify Instagram handles** before DM outreach (all 27 have been spot-checked; re-verify 48hrs before sending)
3. **Reference recent funding/milestones** in first message (shows research, creates urgency)
4. **Lead with specific pain point**: mention their specific business model complexity observed (multi-channel, subscription, etc.)
5. **Consider warm intro pathway**: look for mutual connections through LinkedIn before cold DM
