## 1. MAELOVE Skincare — @maeloveskincare (Instagram)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**
Hey Jackie — using AI to analyze 3M+ reviews to formulate is a brilliant moat. Quick question: are you tracking what that 100-day money-back guarantee is actually costing per cohort? Skincare brands at your stage running unconditional guarantees typically see 4-7% return rates, but the hidden cost is in the refund processing + restocking waste. At your order volume, tightening the guarantee window from 100 to 60 days usually recovers $1.50-$2.00/order with less than 1% conversion impact. Worth stress-testing if you haven't recently.

**Notes:**
- Data point: Money-back guarantee cost per cohort (4-7% return rate), window optimization ($1.50-$2.00/order recovery)
- References: AI review analysis (3M+ products), 100-day guarantee, cult status of Glow Maker
- Why this works: Attorney-turned-CEO will respect data-driven analysis. MIT co-founders mean they value quantitative approach.
- No ProfitMaxxing mention; analyst peer tone

## 2. Ciele Cosmetics — @cielecosmetics (Instagram)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**
Hey Nikki — acne-safe SPF in color cosmetics is a smart whitespace play. Quick thought: launching into 270 Sephora doors while running DTC creates a margin split most founding teams don't catch early. Sephora takes 50-55% on color cosmetics, so your $34-$44 SKUs are netting $15-$20 wholesale vs. $28-$36 DTC. If you're not tracking contribution margin per channel separately, retail growth can quietly compress overall profitability. Usually worth catching before the second Sephora order.

**Notes:**
- Data point: Sephora wholesale margin take (50-55% on color cosmetics), per-channel contribution margin gap
- References: 270 Sephora doors, $34-$44 price point, acne-safe SPF positioning
- Celebrity makeup artist founder — product-obsessed, likely not tracking financials granularly
- No ProfitMaxxing mention

## 3. Rae Wellness — @raewellness (Instagram)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**
Hey Angie — 50/50 digital-physical split is the sweet spot most supplement brands are chasing but few actually hit. With your Target background you probably already think about this, but curious: are you tracking true contribution margin per channel after accounting for retail slotting fees, co-op ad requirements, and chargebacks? Supplement brands running omnichannel at your stage typically see a 15-22% margin gap between DTC and retail that doesn't surface until you do a full channel P&L. Happy to pull benchmarks if useful.

**Notes:**
- Data point: 15-22% margin gap between DTC and retail in supplements (slotting, co-op, chargebacks)
- References: 50/50 digital-physical split, Target background, Gen Z focus
- Risk: Ex-Target SVP means high operational sophistication — DM must respect that. "You probably already think about this" acknowledges her expertise.

## 4. Liis Fragrance — @liisfragrances (Instagram)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**
Hey Leslie — bootstrapping a luxury fragrance brand to where Choux Choux alone is driving significant revenue is impressive execution. Quick thought: when one SKU carries that much of the top line, the cash flow concentration risk is real. Most indie fragrance brands at your stage don't model what happens to working capital if that hero product has a supply chain delay or a seasonal dip. Also — at $175/bottle, are you tracking your true CAC by influencer vs. organic? Luxury fragrance usually sees a 3-4x spread between those channels. Worth knowing which is actually profitable.

**Notes:**
- Data point: Hero product cash flow concentration risk + CAC spread by channel (3-4x between influencer vs. organic)
- References: Choux Choux ($175), bootstrapped, co-founder duo
- Two angles in one DM — product concentration risk + CAC channel analysis
- No ProfitMaxxing mention

## 5. Hawthorne — @hawthorne (Instagram)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**
Hey Brian — the quiz-based personalization model at Hawthorne is smart for repeat purchases, but it also creates SKU complexity most brands underestimate. Quick question: with cologne, shampoo, deodorant, and candles all running through a customization engine, are you tracking contribution margin per product category or just blended? Multi-category personal care brands typically see one category subsidizing the others by 10-15% without anyone noticing. Usually it's the lower-AOV SKUs dragging the blend down. Have you done that breakdown?

**Notes:**
- Data point: Cross-category margin subsidization (10-15% gap), SKU complexity from personalization
- References: Quiz-based customization, multi-category (cologne, shampoo, deodorant, candles), USA-manufactured
- Risk: Wharton MBA co-founder = financially sophisticated. DM must be sharp.
- No ProfitMaxxing mention

## 6. JustNails Professional — @justnails_professional (Instagram)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**
Hey Alexandra — 233% YoY growth while shipping worldwide from Germany is serious execution. Quick insight: at that growth pace, your fulfillment cost per order is almost certainly creeping up faster than your reporting shows. German-based DTC brands shipping internationally typically see 12-18% in hidden logistics costs once you factor customs clearance, returned package handling, and zone-based carrier rate increases that kick in at your volume tier. Are you tracking true landed cost per order by destination market? Most founders at this stage aren't — and there's usually $1-2/order sitting there.

**Notes:**
- Data point: 12-18% hidden international logistics costs, $1-2/order recovery opportunity
- References: 233% YoY, Germany-based, worldwide shipping, Gel-X distributor
- International angle is strong — cross-border complexity is exactly where ProfitMaxxing adds value
- No ProfitMaxxing mention

## 7. Kindroot — @kindroot (Instagram)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**
Hey Alisa — the hand-poured production model at Kindroot is great for margins but creates a scaling wall most founders don't see coming. Quick question: have you modeled at what order volume you'd need to shift from hand-poured to automated production, and what that does to your unit economics? Functional wellness brands in the $1-1.5M range typically hit a breakeven point where the labor cost of hand production exceeds the premium it commands. At that crossover, your COGS can jump 15-25% if you're not planning the transition ahead of time. Worth modeling if you haven't.

**Notes:**
- Data point: Hand-production to automated scaling breakeven, 15-25% COGS jump risk at transition
- References: Hand-poured LA production, Candy Hall of Fame scientist, limited SKUs (Focus, Mood, Snooze, Glow)
- Ex-Unilever/Nestlé marketer — understands brand but may not have manufacturing finance depth
- No ProfitMaxxing mention

## 8. Evolvetogether — @we_evolvetogether (Instagram)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**
Hey Cynthia — the dissolvable packaging innovation at Evolvetogether is exactly the kind of thing that drives press but complicates unit economics. Quick thought: are you tracking what the sustainable packaging premium is actually costing per unit vs. standard alternatives? Multi-category personal care brands running eco-first packaging typically see 20-30% higher packaging COGS, but there's a volume threshold where supplier contracts flip the economics in your favor. With Bluemercury and Amazon both in the mix, you're likely close to that threshold. Worth running the numbers if you haven't recently.

**Notes:**
- Data point: 20-30% sustainable packaging COGS premium + volume threshold for economics flip
- References: Dissolvable packaging, multi-category expansion, Bluemercury + Amazon channels
- Former CFDA designer / Vita Fede founder — creative background, likely needs financial infrastructure
- No ProfitMaxxing mention

## 9. RÓEN Beauty — @roenbeauty (Instagram)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**
Hey Tiffany — the multi-retailer approach at RÓEN (Bluemercury, Credo, select Sephora) is smart for distribution but creates margin tracking complexity most indie beauty brands miss. Quick question: are you tracking gross margin per retail partner separately? Each retailer negotiates different wholesale terms, return policies, and co-marketing requirements. Clean luxury brands running 3+ retail channels typically see a 12-20% margin spread between their best and worst performing partners — and most don't know which is which until they do the analysis. Happy to share what I'm seeing from comparable brands.

**Notes:**
- Data point: 12-20% margin spread across retail partners, per-partner margin tracking gap
- References: Bluemercury + Credo + Sephora multi-channel, clean luxury positioning, ingredient transparency
- Founder is creative director — product/brand focused, unlikely to have deep financial ops
- No ProfitMaxxing mention
