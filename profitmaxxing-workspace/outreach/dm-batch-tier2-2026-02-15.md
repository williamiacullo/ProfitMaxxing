## Fran Miller — @fran__miller (IG DM)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**

Hey Fran — the zero-waste manufacturing at F. Miller is the real deal, not many brands actually partner with TerraCycle. Quick question: have you benchmarked what that 100% post-consumer packaging is actually costing per unit vs. standard? Botanical skincare brands at your size typically see packaging running 18-24% of COGS when they go full sustainable. Most don't realize there's a breakeven point where volume discounts on eco materials actually flip the economics in your favor. Usually around the $1.2M revenue mark. Want me to pull the comparison?

**Notes:** Instagram DM, no char limit. References specific sustainability initiatives (TerraCycle partnership, post-consumer waste packaging). Data point: sustainable packaging cost as % of COGS and the volume breakeven threshold. Queer-owned brand in Toronto — small team, product-obsessed founder (former creative director), unlikely to have financial infrastructure.

## Jamil Bhuya & Jaz Fenton — @jazyfent / @yellowbeauty (IG DM)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**

Hey — love the origin story behind Yellow Beauty, your mom's turmeric recipe turning into a full product line is exactly the kind of brand story that converts. Quick thought: you're on Shopify, Amazon, Haveda, and Living Earth Beauty — that's 4 channels. Most founders at your stage track revenue by channel but not margin by channel. When we look at turmeric/botanical brands running multi-channel, there's usually a 12-18% margin gap between DTC and marketplace. One channel is subsidizing the others and you don't know which. Have you done that breakdown?

**Notes:** References specific origin story (mom's recipe, Bangladesh), multi-channel presence (all 4 platforms named). Data point: multi-channel margin gap analysis. The 10% to Plan International donation is a real cost center worth analyzing too, but don't lead with that — it's mission-critical to them.

**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**

Hey Ty — the 153% subscription revenue growth at Joggy is impressive, especially in CBD where customer acquisition is brutal. Curious about something I keep seeing with CBD wellness brands on Smartrr: the subscription LTV numbers look great on paper, but when you factor in regulatory compliance costs per SKU and the water-based liposomal manufacturing premium, true contribution margin per subscriber is usually 15-20% lower than what the dashboard shows. Are you tracking net contribution margin per subscription cohort, or just revenue?

**Notes:** References specific growth stat (153%), specific platform (Smartrr), specific tech (water-based liposomal delivery). Data point: subscription contribution margin gap when factoring CBD compliance and manufacturing premium. Ty is sophisticated (ex-Outdoor Voices founder, built TYB platform) so this DM is more advanced than others.

## Allie Griswold / Maria Markina — @athenaclub (IG DM)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**

Hey — the Juicy Couture collab razor was a smart play on nostalgia. Quick question on the subscription side: are you tracking what your welcome discount is actually costing per acquired subscriber? Subscription wellness brands on Shopify Plus running 15-20% welcome offers typically see 55-65% of those conversions would have happened at full price. That's pure margin leakage. At your order volume, even dropping from 15% to 10% usually recovers $4-6 per order with less than 3% conversion drop. Have you tested that?

**Notes:** References specific collab (Juicy Couture, Oct 2024), specific platform (Shopify Plus), subscription model. Data point: welcome discount margin leakage for subscription brands. Founders are ex-McKinsey so they'll respect data-driven outreach. Also expanding to Target = channel complexity.

## Ali & Zoe Wasfy — @wildsciencelab (IG DM)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**

Hey — congrats on the Boots expansion, getting into a retailer that size is a huge milestone for a science-backed clean beauty brand. Quick thought: brands your size that go from DTC-only to DTC + major retail usually see a 20-30% margin compression on the retail side that isn't visible in top-line growth. Boots negotiates hard on wholesale pricing. Are you tracking your blended margin across channels, or just revenue growth? Most founders at this stage see revenue up 40% but net margin stays flat. Happy to pull clean beauty benchmarks for DTC vs. retail if that's useful.

**Notes:** References Boots UK expansion specifically. Data point: DTC vs. retail margin compression when entering major retail. UK-based brand but the financial dynamics are universal. Co-founders Ali (CEO) and Zoe (Creative Director) — medical expertise driving product, unlikely to have deep financial infrastructure.

## Gyada Yildirim — @gyadacosmetics (IG DM)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**

Hey Gyada — 161% revenue growth over 3 years while expanding to 700+ retailers is serious execution. Quick question: with that kind of international retail expansion, are you tracking your true landed cost per unit across different markets? European clean beauty brands shipping across borders usually have 8-14% in hidden costs (duties, VAT reconciliation, distributor margins, compliance per market) that don't show up in the invoice price. At your revenue level that gap is usually $0.60-$1.40/unit. Most founders don't see it until they do a full unit economics audit. Happy to share what I'm seeing from comparable brands.

**Notes:** References specific growth stat (161%), retailer count (700+). Data point: international expansion hidden costs per unit. At $5.3M she's at the very top of our range but the international complexity = exactly our value prop. 69K Instagram followers = engaged audience.

## Respire Founders — via @respire (IG DM or brand contact)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**

Hey — the refillable deodorant system at Respire is perfectly timed. 72% plastic reduction per refill cycle is a strong sustainability story. Curious: have you modeled the unit economics of refill vs. new? Most brands running refillable programs assume the refill is more profitable because materials cost less, but when you factor in reverse logistics, quality control on returned containers, and the lower AOV per refill purchase, the margin picture is more nuanced. Clean beauty brands with refillable lines typically see 8-15% lower contribution margin on refills until they hit a volume threshold. Want me to pull the comparison data?

**Notes:** References specific stat (72% plastic reduction), specific product (refillable deodorant). Data point: refillable packaging unit economics and the counterintuitive margin dynamics. French brand — DM in English is fine for business outreach. Pharmacy + online hybrid model adds complexity.
