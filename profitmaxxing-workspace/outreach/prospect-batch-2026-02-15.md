## Research Notes

**Twitter/X Pain-Signal Search Results (10 queries executed):**
- Query results heavily dominated by marketing gurus, agency owners, and SaaS providers — NOT actual DTC brand founders
- Genuine founder pain signals were rare in public tweets — most founders complain in private communities (Slack, Discord, closed Facebook groups)
- Best pain signals came from replies to financial/3PL threads, not original tweets
- Most actionable approach: monitor reply threads on 3PL, CAC, and financial content creators

**Reddit:** Blocked by browser safety restrictions. Could not access r/ecommerce, r/shopify, or r/dtc.

**Instagram:** Authenticated and searched #dtcbrand, #dtcfounder, #shopifystore, #cleanbeauty. Results were dominated by influencer product reviews, web design agencies selling Shopify templates, and very early-stage brands (pre-revenue). The #dtcfounder hashtag surfaced a post from @beviciousnyc looking for early-stage DTC founders — 3 people commented "FOUNDER" but all were service providers or personal accounts, not product brand owners. Instagram hashtag browsing is not efficient for this target profile ($500K–$5M revenue). Better approach: use Instagram to research specific brands already identified from other sources.

**Brand Directories (1800DTC, Shopify Blog, Industry Articles):** Excellent for identifying brands in target categories, but limited founder Twitter handles and revenue data.

**Revenue Estimates:** All estimates are based on context clues (team size, funding, product range, social following, press mentions). Confidence: LOW to MEDIUM. Actual revenue verification would require Shopify store analytics tools (StoreCensus, Charm.io, PipeCandy).

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Use Charm.io or StoreCensus to filter Shopify brands by estimated revenue ($500K–$5M) in target categories
2. Monitor @overreact, @Bishwajeetkjha, @onpointctrller reply threads for actual DTC founders with pain signals
3. Join DTC Slack/Discord communities (Operators, DTC Twitter community) for warm prospecting
4. Re-run Twitter searches weekly — pain signals are time-sensitive
