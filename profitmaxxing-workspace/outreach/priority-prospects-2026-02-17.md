## New Qualified Prospects (6)

### Tier 1 — Best Fit

| # | Brand | Category | Founder | Est Revenue | URL | Pain Signal | Best Template |
|---|-------|----------|---------|-------------|-----|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | Prequel | Skincare | Dr. Samantha Ellis | $1-2M | prequelskin.com | Dermatologist-founded, early stage growth, likely no finance person. 336K YouTube subs = real audience. DTC-focused. | B — reference their science-first approach and dermatologist formulation complexity |
| 2 | Dieux | Skincare | Charlotte Palermino, Joyce de Lemos | $2-4M | dieuxskin.com | Just entered Sephora = dual-channel complexity. Viral reusable eye masks. Small team scaling fast. | B — reference Sephora expansion and what that does to fulfillment/margin tracking |
| 3 | Three Ships | Skincare | Connie Lo, Laura Burget | $3-5M | threeshipsbeauty.com | Canadian, 65% YoY, managing DTC + retail expansion. Raised $4.4M but likely no dedicated CFO. | B — reference growth rate and dual-channel margin leakage |

### Tier 2 — Worth Pursuing

| # | Brand | Category | Founder | Est Revenue | URL | Pain Signal | Best Template |
|---|-------|----------|---------|-------------|-----|-------------|---------------|
| 4 | Phlur | Fragrance | Chriselle Lim (acquired brand) | $4-7M | phlur.com | Clean fragrance, 100%+ DTC growth, strong organic traffic. Ingredient sourcing complexity. | B — reference fragrance-specific COGS (essential oils, glass packaging) |
| 5 | Pepper | Intimates | Jaclyn Fu | $3-5M | wearpepper.com | Niche positioning (AA/A/B cups), community-driven. Likely bootstrapped. Small team. | B — reference inventory complexity for niche sizing (high SKU count, lower volume per SKU) |
| 6 | Serious Tissues | Home/Paper | Unknown | $1-2M | serioustissues.com | UK-based, sustainability focus, upcycled products. Early stage, bootstrapped. | B — reference sustainability brands' unique COGS (recycled materials sourcing premiums) |

### Tier 3 — Exploratory

| # | Brand | Category | Notes |
|---|-------|----------|-------|
| Parade | Intimates | $5-8M, zero paid spend, community-driven. Could be a fit but may have finance coverage at that size. |
| Hilma | Athletic shoes | $2-4M, founder-athlete. Not core category but physical product complexity is there. |
