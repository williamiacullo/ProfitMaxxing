# ProfitMaxxing Outreach — DM Batch 2026-02-17
## Template B — Personalized Tier 1 Prospects

## Prequel — @prequelskin (Instagram)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**
Hey! Saw your science-first approach to formulation — that clinical-grade ingredient work is complex. The data shows dermatologist-founded brands at your stage typically track COGS at ingredient level but leave 15-20% in hidden costs uncaptured (stability testing, compliance, wastage tracking). Worth a look if you want to understand your true product cost baseline.

**Notes:**
- Data point: 15-20% hidden COGS complexity in clinical skincare (testing, compliance, wastage)
- Why this angle: Dermatologist-formulated products have regulatory + stability testing overhead that most COGS tracking systems miss. High credibility angle.
- Timing: $1-2M revenue stage is when this creep becomes material
- No ProfitMaxxing mention; analyst tone

## Dieux — @dieuxskin (Instagram)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**
Congrats on the Sephora entry — major milestone. Quick insight: we see across brands that Sephora expansion creates a margin trap most teams don't catch early. DTC margins run 65-70%, but wholesale sits at 45-50% after their take. The trap? Teams don't track contribution margin per channel, so retail growth can actually compress overall profit. Early flag might be worth 6 figures.

**Notes:**
- Data point: DTC 65-70% margin vs. Sephora 45-50% post-wholesale; most brands don't track per-channel contribution margin
- Why this angle: Sephora expansion is a visible win, but hidden margin compression is a common killer at their scale ($2-4M). Positioning this as early warning, not failure.
- Timing: Just entered Sephora = perfect moment to flag before margin dilution locks in
- No ProfitMaxxing mention; peer advisory tone

## Three Ships — @threeshipsbeauty (Instagram)
**Template:** B
**Platform:** Instagram DM
**Message:**
65% YoY growth is impressive — especially with the raise and US expansion. One data point we track: at that growth pace, fulfillment cost per order typically creeps 8-12% before it surfaces in reporting. Add cross-border duty/freight complexity on Canadian brands shipping to the US, and true landed cost often surprises. Worth stress-testing if you haven't recently.

**Notes:**
- Data point: 8-12% fulfillment cost creep at 65%+ YoY growth; cross-border duty/freight complexity inflates landed cost
- Why this angle: High-growth Canadian brands scaling to US don't always model cross-border logistics costs correctly. Fulfillment cost inflation is often the last metric they audit.
- Timing: Post-raise and mid-expansion = capital deployed but margins not yet optimized
- No ProfitMaxxing mention; data-driven peer tone

## Data Point Variation Check Table

| Brand | Angle | Primary Metric | Secondary Insight | Confidence |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Prequel | COGS complexity | 15-20% hidden costs | Clinical formulation + testing overhead | High |
| Dieux | Margin trap | 65-70% DTC vs. 45-50% wholesale | Per-channel contribution margin tracking gap | High |
| Three Ships | Cost creep + logistics | 8-12% fulfillment inflation | Cross-border complexity (CA → US) | High |

## Outreach Notes
- **Platform:** Instagram DM (all three)
- **Character count:** All three messages are <500 characters (Instagram DM friendly)
- **Tone:** Analyst, peer, no pitch language
- **No ProfitMaxxing mention:** All three lead with data, not brand
- **Follow-up trigger:** Each message identifies a specific uncaptured opportunity (COGS, margin, cost) that naturally leads to "want to dig into this?" conversation
